    question: "Where is SoberDev based?",

      "SoberDev is a software development studio based in Delhi, India. We work remotely with startups and small businesses across India and internationally, and you can reach us at contact@soberdev.in or +91 8595105597.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a website cost in India?",
    answer:
      "At SoberDev, landing pages start at ₹12,000, portfolio sites at ₹8,000, and full-stack web apps at ₹35,000. Final pricing depends on scope, number of screens, and whether the build needs custom backend work or third-party integrations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical project take?",
    answer:
      "Landing pages take 1 to 2 weeks and full-stack web apps take 4 to 8 weeks. Timelines depend on complexity and how quickly feedback comes back, and we confirm a schedule in writing before the build starts.",

  {
    question: "Do you work with clients across India?",

      "Yes. SoberDev is based in Delhi and works with startups and small businesses throughout India, including Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, and Hyderabad, as well as international clients. Every engagement runs remotely with direct access to the founders.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build Android and iOS apps?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We build cross-platform mobile apps with React Native and responsive progressive web apps, so a single codebase runs on both Android and iOS. This keeps build cost and ongoing maintenance lower than two separate native apps.",
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies does SoberDev use?",
    answer:
      "Our core stack is React, Next.js, and TypeScript on the front end, with Node.js and Express APIs backed by MongoDB or MySQL. We also work with Python, Django, React Native, Tailwind CSS, Docker, and AWS, and deploy to Vercel, Render, or Railway.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your development process?",
    answer:
      "Four stages: discovery, design direction, build, and deployment. You work directly with the founders rather than an account manager, receive weekly progress updates, and review working software instead of static mockups.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide support after launch?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every project includes a post-launch window for fixes, plus handover documentation and deployment access so you own the product outright. Ongoing maintenance and feature work can be arranged as a monthly retainer.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I start a project with SoberDev?",
